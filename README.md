# Portfolio Website
My portfolio website succinctly communicates my background, experience, education, and skills. Created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, it provides a comprehensive overview of my professional profile in a visually appealing and user-friendly format.

## Setup and Configuration

To setup, download the files and run `npm install` to get all the Gulp dev dependencies. Next, run `Gulp watch` to compile the Sass and minify the JavaScript. Additionally, if you don't have Gulp installed globally, you can run the npm script `npm run watch`. Any changes to the JavaScript (js/scripts.js) or Sass (sass/styles.scss) will be autocompiled and ready to go.

All scripts are within `js/scripts.js` and get minified to `js/scripts.min.js`. All styles are in `sass/styles.scss` and get compiled to `css/styles.css`. Both the minified scripts file and compiled CSS file are what is loaded on the page by default.

At this point, the page is ready to go and you will be able to run the code of my Portfolio Website.
