                        <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
                            I have implemented the notification feature for the InstaPing application, utilizing React.js for the frontend functionalities and CSS for the user interface styling. The 'Client' is designed to manage browser-related code, while the 'Socket' is dedicated to handling connections through the Socket.IO library, facilitating communication with the Node.js server. In the application, users can click on a heart-shaped icon to 'like' a post, resulting in the icon turning red, and a notification is sent to the user, informing them that their post has been liked by another InstaPing user.

                            We have designed a georeferencing feature on Nature's Palette website as a group project that allows users to search for bird species based on their biological details. The results are displayed as markers on Google Maps. Also, we implemented shape drawing functionality for data collection and enabled marker hover-over to provide location details. This feature highlights concentrated bird species availability, making it easier for users to identify them.                        </p>

                            This web application, built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, provides a secure university printing service. It features user authentication for both students and professors. Users can easily upload files for printing, and the system intelligently stores them on Docker, a cloud storage platform. The convenience of accessing previously uploaded files makes the printing process more efficient and user-friendly, contributing to effective resource management within the university's printing service.

                            I employed Python Visualizations to uncover patterns in data, enhancing the overall performance of the landscaping company. This included assessing customer satisfaction, identifying improvement areas, analyzing employee efficiency, and exploring the correlation between employee performance and company growth.
